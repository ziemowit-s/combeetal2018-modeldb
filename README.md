This is a "fork" from CA1 pyramidal neuron (Combe et al 2018) from:

The intention of this fork is to create a file containing all Ca currents for all time steps for apical dendrites.

# The original description:
"Gamma oscillations are thought to play a role in learning and memory. Two distinct bands, slow (25-50 Hz) and fast 
(65-100 Hz) gamma, have been identified in area CA1 of the rodent hippocampus. Slow gamma is phase-locked to activity 
in area CA3 and presumably driven by the Schaffer collaterals. We used a combination of computational modeling and in 
vitro electrophysiology in hippocampal slices of male rats to test whether CA1 neurons responded to Schaffer collateral 
stimulation selectively at slow gamma frequencies, and to identify the mechanisms involved. Both approaches demonstrated
 that in response to temporally precise input at Schaffer collaterals, CA1 pyramidal neurons fire preferentially in the 
 slow gamma range regardless of whether the input is at fast or slow gamma frequencies, suggesting frequency selectivity 
 in CA1 output with respect to CA3 input. In addition, phase-locking, assessed by the vector strength, was more precise 
 for slow gamma than fast gamma input. ..."
